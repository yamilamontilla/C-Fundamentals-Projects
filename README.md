# C Fundamentals Projects

This repository contains a collection of C programs developed during my university coursework. Each exercise focuses on fundamental programming concepts such as memory management, file input/output, recursion, sorting algorithms, and basic data structures. These projects have been essential for developing my problem-solving skills and understanding how to write efficient code.

## Projects Included

- `binary_search_recursive.c` – Performs a binary search using recursion.
- `bubble_sort_array.c` – Sorts an array using the Bubble Sort algorithm.
- `convolution_of_arrays.c` – Calculates the convolution between two arrays.
- `fast_power_calculation.c` – Efficiently computes powers using exponentiation by squaring.
- `insert_and_sort_digit.c` – Inserts a digit into an array and sorts it.
- `recursive_fast_power.c` – Another approach to fast exponentiation using recursion.
- `reverse_substring_between_stars.c` – Reverses a substring located between two asterisks.
- `search_number_in_matrix.c` – Finds a number in a sorted matrix (row and column wise).

## Tech Used

- Language: C
- IDE: CLion / VS Code
- OS: Windows

## Notes

This repository serves both as a reference for my learning progress and as a practical resource for anyone reviewing C basics.
